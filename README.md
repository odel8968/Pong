1. Download the code archive from github.

2. Unzip code archive in desired folder.

3. The game can be run directly with the Pong.exe file.

4. If you wish to edit or rebuild the project, you will need to open it in Unity (Directions for installing Unity can be found at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). Once Unity is running, in the menus, navigate to File -> Open Project (or add project if using Unity Hub) and select the location of your unzipped archive.

5. Once the project is opened, you will have to open the Pong scene by selecting File -> Open Scene and selecting Pong.unity. From here you can change or rebuild the project as desired.
